# Overview
Kiln prepares all resource configuration files on your computer, using 
[Helm](https://helm.sh) and, deploys them from your computer, using `kubectl`.  

This allows you to use Helm without a Tiller container.

# Install
Kiln is a Bash script. Simply download it and place it in your path.  

The script requires [Helm](https://helm.sh) and `kubectl` to be in your 
system path as well.

# Usage
Run Kiln with the `--help` / `-h` option to see usage details.

# Name
A dumb cute name.  

A Kiln takes uncooked clay hardens it.  
The Kiln tool takes a Helm chart and renders it into a static set of files.

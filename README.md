# Overview
Kiln prepares all resource configuration files on your computer, using 
[Helm](https://helm.sh) and, deploys them from your computer, using `kubectl`.  

This allows you to use Helm without a Tiller container.

# Install
Kiln is a Bash script. Simply download it and place it in your path.  

The script requires [Helm](https://helm.sh) and `kubectl` to be in your 
system path as well.
